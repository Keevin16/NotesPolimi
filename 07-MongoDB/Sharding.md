>The Sharding is the **Distributed [[Partitioning]]** across multiple machines/nodes.

---
In this way is possible to enable:
	• **[[Scale]]**: needed by Modern applications to support massive
	workloads and data volume.
	• **[[Geo-Locality]]**: to support geographically distributed deployments to
	support optimal UX for customers across vast geographies.
	• **[[Hardware Optimizations]]**: on Performance vs. Cost
	• **[[Lower Recovery Times]]**: to make “Recovery Time Objectives” (RTO)
	feasible.

Sharding involves a **[[Shard key]]** defined by a data modeler that describes the partition space of a data set.
