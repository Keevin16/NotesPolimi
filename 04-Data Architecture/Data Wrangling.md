Is the process of transforming **raw, messy, or unstructured data** into a clean and structured format suitable for analysis. It is a critical step in any data workflow, ensuring that data can be trusted and used to generate **valid, actionable insights**.

This process typically involves:

- **Understanding the data**: Identifying data types, patterns, and inconsistencies.
- **Cleansing**: Removing or correcting missing, duplicate, or erroneous entries.
- **Augmenting**: Enriching the dataset with additional relevant information (e.g., derived columns, external sources).
- **Shaping and structuring**: Reorganizing the data (e.g., pivoting, flattening nested formats) to match the needs of analysis tools or algorithms.

The end goal is to convert data into an **optimal format**, such as **columnar** layout (used in systems like Apache Parquet), which enhances performance in analytical workloads by improving compression and query efficiency.

Why it's important?
Raw data from real-world sources (logs, sensors, social media, etc.) is rarely clean or structured. Without proper wrangling:

- Analysis results may be misleading or invalid.
- Processing systems may become inefficient or fail.
- Machine learning models may underperform.

Data wrangling ensures **data quality**, which directly affects the **accuracy** and **reliability** of decisions made based on the data.
