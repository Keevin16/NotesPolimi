The properties are:
	[[Atomicity]]: **atomic transformation** from the initial state to the final state
	[[Consistency]]: trans. satisfies the integrity constraints  
	[[Isolation]]:  trans. is not affected by the behavior of other, concurrent trans.
	[[Durability]]: The effect of a trans. that has successfully committed will last “forever”

**Goal**: Focused on strong [[Consistency]] and [[Reliability]].
