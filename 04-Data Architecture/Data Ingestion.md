The process of **importing, transferring, and loading data** is a fundamental step in Big Data architectures, enabling efficient storage and subsequent analysis. This phase involves collecting data from a variety of sources — such as databases, logs, sensors, APIs, and external files — and preparing it for use within a data platform.
It's the first process of a Data pipeline!!

To optimize performance and storage efficiency, the data often undergoes **transformation and formatting**. This may include cleaning, standardizing, or re-structuring the data. A common technique in Big Data systems is the adjustment of file sizes:

- **Small files** (e.g., logs or sensor data) are **concatenated** into larger files, typically hundreds of megabytes, to reduce overhead and improve processing efficiency.
- **Large files** are **split** into smaller chunks (also hundreds of megabytes) to enable **parallel processing** and distributed storage across the system.

**AIM**: 
	data is stored in a way that supports **scalability**, **fault tolerance**, and **fast access** in distributed systems.
