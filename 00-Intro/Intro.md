#### [[Data-Driven]] Decision Making

- Companies now rely on data for decision-making, moving away from instinct-based decisions.
- Data-driven decisions are more effective, predictable, and profitable.
- Requires large amounts of well-organized and stored data.
- Analytical capability depends on available data, which limits execution capability.

#### Definition of Big Data
Big data is characterized by the **[[4 V's]]**:
1. **Volume**: Ranges from Terabytes to Petabytes.
2. **Variety**: Includes structured (e.g., relational tables), semi-structured (e.g., JSON, XML), and unstructured data (e.g., text, multimedia).
3. **Velocity**: Continuous data streams requiring real-time or near-real-time analysis.
4. **Veracity**: Data can be imprecise and unpredictable, requiring management.
