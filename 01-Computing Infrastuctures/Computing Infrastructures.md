>Modern large-scale [[Data Center]] require the seamless integration of **different components** - **applications**, **computation nodes**, **storage** **devices**, and **networks** - into one [[Computing Infrastructures]].

Based on the **Computation Speedup** and **RAM** is possible to split in different CI solutions:

-_> [[Embedded Pc]]
-_> [[Edge or Fog Computing]]
-_> [[Data Center]]
