**Fog computing**, is an architecture that uses [[Fog Nodes]] to carry out a **substantial amount** of **computation**, **storage**, and **communication locally** and routed over the Internet backbone. 
The main difference with the **Edge computing** is associated with the location **where the data is processed**, which uses the [[Edge Nodes]]  . 

 >**Good** to enable real-time or near-real-time processing without saturating network links to distant data centers.

#### Advantages
  - **Reduced Latency**: Faster processing and real-time decisions (e.g., industrial control, autonomous vehicles).
  - **Bandwidth Efficiency**: Pre-aggregation or filtering reduces data sent to remote data centers.
#### Challenges
  - **Power/Cooling**: Edge servers are more powerful than IoT devices but must often operate outside traditional data center environments.
  - **Security & Management**: Distributing compute across many edge nodes complicates updates and monitoring.
