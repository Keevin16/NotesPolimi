> Small, low-power microcontrollers or sensors with limited CPU, memory, and storage. Often battery-powered, focusing on data collection (e.g., temperature, motion, camera snapshots).

> They are designed for **data collection** and **lightweight computations** in environments ranging from industrial plants to consumer appliances.

- **Use Cases**: Smart buildings (temperature/humidity monitoring), wearable health trackers, industrial machine sensors.

- **Constraints**: Must minimize energy usage and typically rely on lightweight communication protocols.
