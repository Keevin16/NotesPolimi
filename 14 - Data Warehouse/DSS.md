>DSS stands for **Decision Support System** and it's an Information technology to help the knowledge worker (executive, manager, analyst) make faster & better decisions, with the help of the [[OLAP]].

As is possible to see in the picture the DSS it's split in three tier

**Information Sources** - Before all the data are collected from multiple sources 

**Data Warehouse** - It's putted everything on the Data warehouse, but the problem was that at some point it'll contain a **huge amount of diverse data,** **too big to be used in a efficient way**!
For this reason come out the  [[Data Mars]], which are **subset** of Data Warehouse **focused** on a **field** of interest.
Otherwise there are the [[Virtual Warehouse]] which are a logical layer built on top of multiple data source, that allow **unified access** to data **without physically copying or moving it**.

**OLAP server** - can be of two types according to the needs --> [[Multidimensional OLAP (MOLAP)]] or [[Relational OLAP (ROLAP)]]

At the end there's the customer that makes the analysis on the data
