It's possible to build in several way a Data Warehouse, according to the needs.

#### [[Single Layer]]
>Every data element is stored once only on a virtual warehouse.

#### [[Two Layer]]
>It's combined the real time data (collected from operational systems) and the derived data (processed or pre-aggregated for analytical purposes).
>It's the most used one in industry.

#### [[Three Layer]]
>It's identical to the [[Two Layer]], with the only difference that there's a layer where the data are cleaned from the real time analysis.
