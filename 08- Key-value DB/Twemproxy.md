>It's a fast and lightweight proxy for [Memcached](http://www.memcached.org/) and [Redis](http://redis.io/) protocol. 
>It was built primarily to reduce the number of connections to the caching servers on the back end.
>This, together with protocol pipe lining and [[Sharding]] enables you to **horizontally** scale your distributed caching architecture.
