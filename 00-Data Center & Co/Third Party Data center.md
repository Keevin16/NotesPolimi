Under **third-party managed hosting**, the **provider owns and operates** both the **data center facility** and the **hardware** (servers, storage, network gear). 
Customers typically rent computing resources, paying for them on a subscription or usage-based model.

>**Good** for the **elasticity** and **minimal** operational overhead
---
#### Advantages

- **Full Control**
	The organization can customize hardware specs, decide on security policies, control physical access, and schedule maintenance without external constraints.

- **Tangible Asset** 
	Owning the building and IT equipment can be an investment, which potentially retains resale or re purposing value (though resale in IT can be limited by rapid technological change).

- **Customization for Specialized Workloads**
	Ideal for high-performance computing (HPC), GPU-intensive tasks (e.g., AI training), or regulated industries requiring strict data sovereignty and compliance measures.

#### Disadvantages

-  **Less Flexibility**
	 Standardized hardware configurations may not accommodate very specialized requirements; customization can be expensive or unavailable.

- **Ongoing Cost**
	Over many years, cumulative rental fees may exceed the cost of in-house ownership, particularly for large or steady workloads.
 
 - **Data Security and Compliance**
	Outsourcing the physical and hardware management requires a high level of trust in the providerâ€™s security measures. Some industries have strict compliance mandates that may limit this option.
