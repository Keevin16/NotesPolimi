**Co-location** involves leasing space in a **third-party data center** to house your organization’s servers and networking equipment.
The **co-location** provider **supplies** the **building infrastructure** (power, cooling, physical security)
The **customer retains ownership** and **operational control** of the actual IT hardware.

>**Good** to mitigate large upfront cost

---
#### Advantages

- **Reduced Capital Expense**: 
	Eliminates the need for constructing a facility or buying large-scale power and HVAC systems.

- **Some Control**
	You still choose and configure your own hardware, with the co-location provider handling the physical building, security, and large-scale infrastructure redundancy (e.g., multiple power feeds, fire suppression).

- **Scalability**
	Adding or removing rack space is typically faster and less complex than expanding an on-premises data center.

#### Disadvantages

- **No Real Estate Asset**
	Leasing means you do not build equity in a physical facility, so costs might be viewed as purely operational.

 - **Limited Customization**:
	 Must adhere to the provider’s guidelines on rack density, power draw, cooling capacities, and physical changes to the space.

- **Potential Access Delays**
	Physical access to servers may require scheduling and sometimes traveling to the co-location site, which could be geographically distant.
