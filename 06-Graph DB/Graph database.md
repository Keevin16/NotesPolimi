>Graph database is a database that uses [[Graph]] structures for semantic queries with nodes, edges, and properties to represent and store data

---
**Advantage**:
- **Efficient Relationship Handling**: Graph databases excel at managing and querying highly connected data, such as social networks.

- **Performance**: They are faster than relational databases for associative data sets because they avoid costly join operations.

- **Object-Oriented Mapping**: Graph databases map more directly to object-oriented applications, making them easier to use in modern software development.

- **Flexibility**: They are schema-free, allowing for easy adaptation to changing data models.

- **Index-free**: Each node acts as a pointer to its adjacent nodes, eliminating the need for index lookups.

-  It's used a Depth-First algorithm to perform the queries, it's completed the first path before moving on to the next.
