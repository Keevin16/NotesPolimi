>Graph database is a database that uses [[Graph]] structures for semantic queries with nodes, edges, and properties to represent and store data

---
**Advantage**:
	- **Efficient Relationship Handling**: Graph databases excel at managing and querying highly connected data, such as social networks.
	- **Performance**: They are faster than relational databases for associative data sets because they avoid costly join operations.
	- **Object-Oriented Mapping**: Graph databases map more directly to object-oriented applications, making them easier to use in modern software development.
	- **Flexibility**: They are schema-free, allowing for easy adaptation to changing data models.
