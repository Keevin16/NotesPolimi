>DOM  is a platform and language-neutral interface that defines how to interact with web pages, enabling developers to create dynamic, responsive and interactive user experience.  

 When a web page is loaded, the browser automatically creates a Document Object Model (DOM) that defines
- HTML elements as objects
- Properties of all HTML elements
- Methods to access all HTML elements
- Events for all HTML elementsÂ   

Different elements of the page are loaded at different time 
	it's important to **understand the structure** of the **page** and the **order** on which the **elements are loaded**:

1. Organizing places of the objects (organizing places of the page)

2. Properties (to form the right shape of the webpage)

3. Methods to access HTML elements (Javascript code)

4. Events for all HTML (clicks, scroll, those are the things that might happen in the webpage)
