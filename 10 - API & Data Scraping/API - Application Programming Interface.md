>API are endpoints from which the user can send some request to gather data.
Thanks to these **endpoints** it's **hidden all the complexity** on how the data is stored.

They are **all different**, for this reason is important to read the documentation before.
To communicate with it are used **HTTP methods** or **Libraries**.
	To dev and test APIs there're many tools, one of them is **Postman**


Examples of some API
- Twitter API: get access to Twitter, used to learn and analyze with tweets.
	v1 --> free and open to everyone
	v2 --> novel and requires the dev to submit authorization

- OpenStreetMap (OSM): collaborative project to create a free editable geographic database of the world

- OpenWeather (OW): provides a set of weather-related products, including short term and long-term forecasting, history and observations for any location.
