It's a **centralized storage system** that allows you to store **all types of data**—structured, semi-structured, and unstructured—in their **raw format** and at **any scale**.

It’s built to handle **big data** and supports **schema-on-read**, meaning you define the data structure **only when you need to read or analyze it**, not when you store it.

The steps of a Data Lake pipeline are:
	-[[Transient zone]] 
	-[[Raw Zone]]
	-[[Trusted Zone]]
	-[[Refined Zone]]
	The last is the [[Consumer System]], which is not part of the data lake zone.
