This data schema approach is the traditional one, the schema is defined before the data is written into storage.

**Key characteristics**:
- **Strict structure**: The data must conform to a **predefined schema** (e.g., column types, data formats).
- **Used in traditional Relational-DBMS** like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle.
- Ensures **data consistency and integrity** at the time of writing.
