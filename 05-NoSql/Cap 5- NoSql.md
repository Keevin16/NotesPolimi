One of the key advantages of **NoSQL** databases is their **flexibility** in handling diverse and evolving data types and structures. 
Unlike traditional **relational databases (SQL)**, which require predefined schemas and rigid table structures, NoSQL systems are designed to **adapt easily to changes** and support **heterogeneous** data.


Here there's a brief explanation of a [[Data Pipeline]]. 

Before the data management approach was the [[Schema On Write]], with a Big data approach we made a step toward with the [[Schema on Read]].

To deal with the [[Schema on Read]], which needs data ready to be processed, in this context is introduced the [[Data Lake]].

We've seen that an important concept is the necessity of increasing the [[Scalability]].

Cause we are working with distributed system, we have to deal with the [[CAP theorem]].
